Automated Bingo Strip Technical Test

First time writing one of these or using gitHub so please excuse any issue.

In order to get the technical exercise up and running on your local machine.

1) Download or clone the files.

2) Ensure NodeJS and npm are up and running on your machine.

3) In the file directory open a command terminal/navigate your terminal to the file location

4) Run 'npm install' from the terminal; the package.json should include the necessary dependencies

5) When that is done run 'gulp watch'

The bingo game should load in your favourite browser
